    <h4>I.&mdash;LE HIGLIFE SCOLASTIQUE.</h4>

    <p>Le recteur regardait avec un air égrillard le museau
    chiffonné de la jolie Madame COPPERFIELD, qui désirait lui
    confier son petit garçon comme élève dans l'institution la plus
    distinguée de tout Paris, une maison où chaque enfant devait
    apporter dans sa petite malle trois couverts en vermeille, et
    un trousseau de six douzaines de chemises en batiste fine; une
    maison où les extras, les vin d'oporto, les beef-tea, les
    sandwich, souvent dépassaient la pension.</p>

    <p>"Voyons, ma belle dame," dit le recteur, "comment
    s'appelle-t'il&mdash;ce petit mome&mdash;pardon&mdash;ce cher
    enfant?"</p>

    <p>"DOMBEY, Monsieur, JONNIE DOMBEY. JONNIE sans l'H."</p>

    <p>"Il est noble?"</p>

    <p>"Mais, non, Monsieur. Son père était banquier, financier,
    que sais-je! Il faisait des affaires
    énormes&mdash;gigantesques! Il regardait les ROTHSCHILD comme
    de nouveaux venus&mdash;il&mdash;" et la gentille petite
    COPPERFIELD se perdait dans un labyrinthe de phrases, et se
    réfugiait dans une énorme houppe à poudre-Sarah, qu'elle
    portait toujours dans son manchon.</p>

             MLLE. ELISABETH TROTTEBOIS.
    </div>

    <p>"Mais il n'était pas noble," dit le recteur, avec dureté;
    "je regrette fort, Madame, de ne pouvoir accepter votre petit
    gosse&mdash;votre fils&mdash;comme élève; mais cette
    institution scolastique est des plus <i>fashionables</i> de
    Paris. Si vous aviez une petite couronne de Marquise sur votre
    carte de visite, si vous étiez descendue d'une voiture
    blasonnée aux chevaux fringants, avec cocher en perruque
    spun-glass, mes bras de père spirituel se seraient ouverts avec
    effusion pour accueillir cet enfant. Mais vous portez sur votre
    oarte un nom suspect, et vous êtes arrivée en voiture de place.
    Ainsi avec la plus haute considération je dois vous prier de
    prendre la peine de débarrasser le plancher. Adieu, mon petit
    bonhomme. Tu as l'air scrofuleux mais charmant."</p>

    <p>Madame COPPERFIELD, qui était entrée comme Zéphire partit
    comme Borée. Sa robe de soie faisait un frou-frou prodigieux
    dans le vestibule. Elle monta dans la voiture au cheval étique,
    aux coussins moisis, tirant le petit JONNIE avec une violence
    hystérique.</p>

    <p>"Parceque tu n'est pas fils de Marquis on m'outrage," elle
    dit, fondant en larmes. "Et pourquoi n'est-tu pas fils de
    Marquis, petite brute? Moi, je ne sais pas."</p>

    <p>Le petit DOMBEY sautait sur les genoux de sa mère; il la
    consolait, et quelques instants plus tard mère et fils suçaient
    emsemble un grand morceau de butter-scotch, pendant que la
    petite écervelée considérait le costume qu'elle devait porter
    le soir au Bal Bullier.</p>

    <h4>II.&mdash;UN GYMNASE À TOUTES LES COULEURS.</h4>

    <p>MADAME COPPERFIELD ne se tenait pas pour vaincue sur cette
    question d'une pension pour le petit. Sa cuisinière lui
    soufflait le nom d'un Monsieur SQUEERS qui habitait dans les
    environs de Clichy, et cette fois c'était la cuisinière qui
    conduisait le petit JONNNIE chez son alumnus; et la cuisinière
    ne faisait pas de façons; c'était à prendre ou à laisser.</p>

    <p>Le bon SQUEERS, qui avait habité auparavant le Yorkshire,
    avait developpé une goutte de sang nègre, et s'était établi
    avec la seconde Madame SQUEERS (soeur cadette de la respectable
    Madame MICAWBER) dans les environs de Clichy. Malheureusement
    il n'avait pas oublié son système anglais, et quoiqu'il faisait
    bien des raffinements sur les rudes et franches pratiques de
    Dotheboys, le système était au fond le même. Il lui fallait
    toujours sa victime&mdash;son SMIKE. À Dotheboys le SMIKE était
    blanc, et s'attachait à NICHOLAS, le pion; à Clichy le SMIKE
    était noir, mais c'était toujours bien SMIKE, qui entrait dans
    la pension bien vêtu, ses frais payés ponctuellement, et qui
    tombait bien bas, jusqu'à balayer le plancher, et à servir à
    table. Et plus tard le SMIKE noir devait mourir accablé de
    cruautés, d'une mort encore plus larmoyante et plus terrible
    que la douce phthisie du SMIKE blanc. Il est mort dans la
    seconde manière de DICKENS, plus travaillée, plus tendue que le
    style jeune et fort de NICKLEBY.</p>

    <h4>III.&mdash;CE QU'ON APPELLE UN BEAU-PÈRE.</h4>

    <p>Il n'y a pas loin du premier chapitre dans la vie de JONNIE
    jusqu'à l'entrée de MURDSTONE&mdash;le MURDSTONE français, dur,
    mais poète, ainsi plus frivole que le MURDSTONE anglais. Mais,
    puisque pour le petit ARRIE tout ce qu'il y a de pénible dans
    l'histoire de son petit cousin anglais doit s'augmenter, le
    MURDSTONE français a des traits des NÉRON et des CALIGULA.
    Naturellement le jeune DOMBEY, se souvenant des escapades du
    cousin, fait son petit voyage d'enfant&mdash;une fuite de la
    pension jusqu'à la maison maternelle où la petite dame s'est
    installée en secondes noces avec MURDSTONE D'ARGENTON, le
    poète. Alors commencent l'éducation de l'enfant par le
    beau-père, les larmes de la mère, le martyre du petit. Que de
    gifles; que de dictionnaires lancés à la tête du chétif
    bambin!</p>

    <p>"Faut qu'il aille quelque part gagner sa vie," dit
    MURDSTONE, qui s'enrageait de plus en plus, à cause de deux
    incommodités dans leur vie de famille, la première que lui,
    MURDSTONE, n'avait pas le génie d'ALFRED DE MUSSET, la seconde
    que l'enfant avait un rhume de cerveau incurable. "Envoyez-le
    laver les bouteilles chez un marchand de vins," proposait un
    ami de la maison.</p>

    <p>"Mais, non, cela ne serait pas assez dur," repondit le
    poète. "Je suis fâché qu'il n'y ait plus à Londres ce bon
    système de ramoneurs-garçons qu'on faisait brûler vifs
    quelquefois dans les cheminées. Faute de cela je le mettrai sur
    la voie ferrée, à graisser les roues avec son petit pot de
    pommade jaune&mdash;et si par hasard il se faisait écraser par
    un train&mdash;tant pis pour lui."</p>

    <p>Il était grand garçon maintenant, ce joli petit JONNIE du
    premier chapitre, et avant de partir pour se perdre entre les
    Parias du pot à graisse sur la ligne d'Est, il s'enhardit
    jusqu'à questionner sa mère sur un sujet qu'elle avait approché
    de temps en temps gentillement du bout des lèvres, en lui
    soufflant des idées romanesques, des visions de ducs espagnols
    et de millionnaires anglais.</p>

    <p>"Dis done, p'tite Maman, comment s'appelait-il, mon
    père?"</p>

    <p>"Mais, mon cheri, naturellement, il s'appelait
    COPPERFIELD."</p>

    <p>"Mais, Maman, tu me disais autrefois qu'il était DOMBEY, un
    grand financier, riche à millions. Se peut-il que de DOMBEY je
    sois devenu COPPERFIELD?"</p>

    <p>La pauvre inconséquente sanglotait avec véhémence&mdash;"Mon
    JONNIE, je te trompais. DOMBEY, le financier raide et hautain,
    n'a jamais existé dans la vie réelle. C'était un mannequin en
    bois. Ton père était DICKENS, le grand romancier anglais. Il
    est mort avant ta naissance. Sans lui tu ne serais pas."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>TO A CORRESPONDENT.&mdash;We do not think you are wise to
    have asked a large circle of distinguished French sporting
    friends to bring their rods over with a view to salmon-fishing
    in the Serpentine. Trout, there may be; no doubt, there are,
    but we have some doubts about salmon. Your suggestion that if
    you can't get a rise you might perhaps "bang away" at the
    waterfowl, certainly has a more promising sound, but we would
    advise you to commence your sport early, for fear of hitting
    the bathers. You will require the permission of the Duke of
    CAMBRIDGE. This you will get through any Park-keeper.</p>

    <p>Look out for <i>Mr. Punch Among the Planets</i>! He is a
    Star of the first magnitude, and the above is the title of his
    Christmas Number. It will issue from, to use astrological
    language, the House of BRADBURY-AGNEW-&amp;-CO., although the
    sidereal and celestial subjects of the forthcoming Christmas
    Number are suggestive of the old days of "BRADBURY and

    youthful Islanders. <i>From Middy to Admiral of the Fleet</i>,
    by Dr. MACAULAY, which is a good long step; but this is the
    life of Commodore ANSON. <i>Up North in a Whaler</i>, by EDWARD
    A. RAND; a pleasant little trip for the Summer
    holidays&mdash;not inviting now&mdash;but try it later. Messrs.
    HUTCHINSON &amp; Co. also publish "<i>The Low-Back'd Car</i>,"
    by SAMUEL LOVER&mdash;an old Song in a fresh setting of
    charming Illustrations, by W. MAGRATH. "We don't kill a pig
    every day!" But just for once and away get <i>My Prague
    Pig</i>, by S. BARING GOULD. W. CLARK RUSSELL's <i>Master
    Rockafellar's Voyage</i>, recommended.</p>

    <p>To the ambitious young entertainer, <i>Magic at Home</i>,
    translated by Professor HOFFMAN, will be a source of delight,
    and if some of the experiments should lead to slight temporary
    inconvenience, it will only help to pass a more cheerful
    evening than usual.</p>

    <p>For drawing-room plays apply to GEORGE ROUTLEDGE, who
    publishes a set, one of which, <i>Acting Charades and
    Proverbs</i>, by ANNE BOWMAN, will be found very useful. A
    Bowman hits the mark.</p>

    <p>Those who know their London <i>au bout des angles</i>, can
    tell you of many quaint spots of beauty, which may be seen when
    it is not quite enveloped in a cheerful fog, though several of
    the more ancient landmarks are fast vanishing; yet in
    <i>Picturesque London</i>, by PERCY FITZGERALD, M.A., F.S.A.,
    will be found a happy collection of all the most taking parts,
    both in odd corners, and interesting structures. Charming
    illustrations by HUME, NISBET, and HERBERT RAILTON.</p>

    <p>Christmas special numbers are not exactly up to date; they
    are turned out so early that by the time they ought to be
    seasonable, they are almost ancient history. <i>The Ladies'
    Pictorial</i> is filled with short stories by popular authors,
    which are well illustrated.</p>

    <p>The earlier part of <i>My Life</i>, by SIDNEY COOPER, R.A.,
    is very interesting, as must almost always be the story of the
    early career of such an ancient mariner as is this well-known
    animal-painter. There must be a halo of romance about
    recollections which no one living can or cares to contradict.
    When these biographical reminiscences come within the memory of
    middle-aged men, then this said memory doth run somewhat to the
    contrary of that of the veteran painter who put the cart before
    the horse, so to speak, in his artistic career, seeing that he
    commenced with carriages and ended with cows. As far as <i>Mr.
    Punch</i> is concerned, the Baron has already denied that
    DOUGLAS JERROLD was ever the Editor of <i>Mr. P.'s</i> paper;
    and Mr. COOPER's account of the <i>Punch</i> dinners must be
    taken with the contents of a well-filled salt-cellar, as Mr.
    SIDNEY COOPER was never present at any one of them.
    Inaccurately he attributes a repartee of THACKERAY's to DOUGLAS
    JERROLD; and the well-known retort of JERROLD to ALBERT SMITH
    he gives so incorrectly, that in this instance the Attic salt
    has lost its savour. There is too much soft-soapiness in his
    reminiscences of personal interviews with Royalty to please
    robust readers. Judging from the latter portion of the second
    volume, wherein, as I should take it, there is considerable
    "padding," it would seem that "the aged P." has already secured
    an excellent position among "the immortals." Hitherto it was
    generally supposed that of the arts Music alone would survive
    <i>in sæcula sæculorum</i>; but perhaps, after all, Painting
    has a chance, and especially animal painting, even though the
    animals may be allegorical. With its pardonable defects of
    memory, and its occasional touch of Royal Windsor Livery
    complaint, the reminiscences of SIDNEY COOPER, R.A., are
    pleasant and, of the first volume especially be it said,
    interesting reading.</p>

    <p><i>Edwin</i> (<i>after the regulation ceremonial</i>). My
    dearest ANGELINA, I have something here which I think will
    greatly simplify the business of house-furnishing, that has so
    deeply occupied us lately.</p>

    <p><i>Angelina</i> (<i>flushing tenderly</i>). Oh, EDWIN,
    <i>have</i> you? How nice, dear! And what is it?</p>

    <p><i>Edwin</i> (<i>eagerly</i>). Quite providential, I call
    it. You know, dearest, I've saved three hundred pounds for the
    express purpose; and here is an advertisement, according to
    which, for about that sum, we can secure a complete fit-out for
    our little villa, which, I think, will exactly suit us. Quite
    an exceptional chance, as the advertiser says. A gentleman,
    lately arrived in this country from India, is unexpectedly
    compelled to return immediately. Consequently he is obliged to
    dispose <i>at once</i> of his lately-purchased house of
    furniture, <i>at a great sacrifice</i>. It is as good as new,
    in fact, has hardly been used at all; is elegant and
    substantial, and can be seen any day at Vamp Villa, Barnsbury,
    upon presentation of visiting-card. Suppose, dearest ANGY, we
    run over to-morrow afternoon, and have a look at it? Such a
    chance&mdash;in the very nick of time, too&mdash;may never
    occur again!</p>

    <p><i>Angelina</i>. Oh, EDWIN, <i>how</i> fortunate! Should it
    suit us, what a lot of trouble it will save!</p>

    <p><i>Edwin</i>. And money, too, darling, for the prices seem
    to be <i>very</i> low. I'm so glad you agree, dear.</p>

    <p><i>Angelina</i> (<i>with effusion</i>). Of <i>course</i> I
    do, EDWIN. And (<i>with tender glance at one of the oil

    <p><i>Loquacious Person</i> (<i>fluently</i>). Why you see,

    yesterday mornin', and was therefore obliged to leave the sale
    of his furniture in our hands. But he is an old client of ours,
    Mr. LIVERLESS is, and he has given us <i>carte blanche</i> as
    regards the disposition of his effects. Only they <i>must</i>
    be sold at once. A retired Colonel at Notting Hill, who seemed
    <i>very</i> sweet on the bargain, promised me a decided answer
    by twelve o'clock to-day. It has not come, and I am free to
    negotiate with the next comer for the furniture as it stands,
    provided an immediate settlement can be arrived at. <i>Wait</i>
    I cannot, but in any other pertikler I shall be only <i>too</i>
    'appy to meet your views.</p>

    <p><i>Edwin</i>. I see the furniture is quite new?</p>

    <p><i>L.P.</i> (<i>with cheery candour</i>). Well, no Sir, not
    quite. Oh, I'll not deceive you! It has been in use a few
    months, and, as you see, is none the worse for <i>that</i>.
    Better, if anything, being fully tested as to seasoning. I need
    'ardly tell <i>you</i>, Sir, that new furniture nowadays is a
    ticklish thing to invest in. <i>Such</i> tricks, my dear Sir,

    carpets throughout are as elegantly hesthetick in design, as
    they are substantial in fabric, whilst the&mdash;ahem! sleeping
    apartments, are perfect pickters of combined solidity and
    chaste elegance. <i>I</i> always say, that as a real gentleman
    is known by his linen, so the 'ome of a party of true taste may
    be tested by the bed-rooms. You'll excuse me,

             alt="G.O.M. Daniel." /></a>G.O.M. DANIEL in the Irish
             Lions' Den.
    </div>

    <p>Years ago, when BRITON RIVIÈRE painted his picture of
    "<i>Daniel in the Lions' Den</i>," which foppishly-speaking men
    would speak of as "<i>Deniel in the Lions' Dan</i>," public
    curiosity was aroused by the fact that DANIEL was facing the
    lions with his back to the spectators. Of course, in this
    instance, the public mind is not exercised by the problem which
    was put to the Showman by an inquiring small boy, in the
    memorable formula of inquiry, "Please, Sir, which is DANIEL,
    and which is the Lions?" as never, for one moment, could there
    have existed, in the densest brain, the smallest doubt as to
    the identity of the Hebrew Seer. Should the question now be put
    by an intending purchaser, Mr. WILLIAM AGNEW has only to give
    an adaptation of the historic reply, and say, "Whichever you
    like, my little dear; <i>if</i> you pay your money, you may
    take your choice."</p>

    <p>Now in this grand picture there is no sort of doubt, "no
    possible doubt whatever," as to which is DANIEL and which are
    the Lions; but there must arise in the spectator's mind the
    question, <i>Who was the painter's model for this figure of</i>
    DANIEL? To this there can be but one answer, "the G.O.M." This
    is the painter's model for DANIEL. Here he stands looking up
    towards the opening and seeing daylight. His hands are tied by
    the bonds of a majority against him. As for the Lions they may
    be Irish Lions, who may be thinking of another grand old DAN,
    The Liberator, but who, once upon a time, in the good old
    Kilmainham Gaol days, would have fallen upon this G.O.M. and
    torn him in pieces; not so now. It is a grand picture.</p>

    <p><i>Colonel Commanding the Battalion</i> (<i>just arrived on
    scene</i>). No water! Well, of course there isn't! Hasn't the
    War Office ordered it to be turned off at night, spite of my
    protests? Tell the Fire-Brigade men to get water wherever they
    can!</p>

    <p><i>Non-Com. Officer</i> (<i>directing two soldiers, who have
    gallantly rescued a couple of children that have been burning
    and suffocating under roof</i>). Yes, take 'em off to the
    hospital! Poor little creatures&mdash;not much hope for
    <i>them</i>, I'm afraid! (<i>To Colonel.</i>) A bad business,
    Sir!</p>

    <p><i>Colonel</i>. Would have been worse if the men hadn't
    behaved so well, and turned themselves into amateur firemen. No
    thanks to the War Office that there aren't twenty-two deaths,
    instead of two. Why, only six months ago, I warned 'em that the
    place was "unfit for human habitation," and a regular
    death-trap in case of fire, with only one narrow wooden
    staircase to the whole block. I wrote that, "if a fire occurred
    at night, there must be many deaths." Yet nothing has been
    done.</p>

    <p><i>Non-Com. Officer</i>. Shocking! There's a talk that the
    place had been condemned by the War Office.</p>

    <p><i>Colonel</i>. Condemned, but not pulled down! I wonder
    who'll be condemned at the Inquest. Shouldn't be surprised if
    it were the War-Office Authorities themselves!</p>

    <h2>THE MODERN HERO;</h2>

    <h3><i>Or, How to Discourage Crime.</i></h3>

    <p>HENRY LARRIKIN, who was recently convicted and sentenced to
    death for the murder of a nursemaid and infant on Shooter's
    Hill, is now confined in &mdash;&mdash; Gaol, and is reported
    to be in excellent spirits. He passes his time in illuminating
    texts, which he presents to the Governor and Warders, and some
    of which have been disposed of for enormous sums. A petition
    has been circulated, and extensively signed, praying for a
    remission of his sentence, on the ground of provocation, it
    having since transpired that the infant put out its tongue in
    passing. Several Jurymen have said, that had this fact been
    brought before them at the trial, they would have returned a
    very different verdict. Much sympathy is expressed with
    LARRIKIN, who is quite a young man. He expresses himself as
    sanguine of a reprieve.</p>

    <h4>CENTRAL NEWS TELEGRAM.&mdash;LATER INTELLIGENCE.</h4>

    <p><i>Monday</i>.&mdash;LARRIKIN was informed this afternoon,
    by the Governor of the Gaol, that the HOME SECRETARY saw no
    grounds for interfering with the course of the Law, and that
    the sentence would consequently be carried out on Friday next.
    Two of the Warders, with whom LARRIKIN is a great favourite, on
    account of the affability and singular modesty of his
    demeanour, were deeply affected, but the prisoner himself bore
    the news with extraordinary fortitude and composure. His sole
    comment upon the intelligence was, that it was "just his
    blooming luck." By special favour of the Authorities he is
    allowed to see the comments of the Press upon his case, in
    which he takes the keenest interest. A statement that he had on
    one occasion been introduced to the nursemaid, through whom his
    career has been so tragically cut short, has caused him the
    deepest irritation. He wishes it to be distinctly understood
    that both she and her infant charge were absolute strangers to
    him.</p>

    <h4>LATER TELEGRAM.</h4>

    <p><i>Wednesday Morning</i>.&mdash;LARRIKIN continues
    wonderfully calm. He is writing his Memoirs, which he has
    already disposed of to a Newspaper Syndicate for a handsome
    consideration. Those who have been privileged to see the
    manuscript report that it reveals traces of unsuspected
    literary talent, and is marked in places by a genial and
    genuine humour. LARRIKIN's great regret is that he will be
    unable to have an opportunity of perusing the press-notices and
    reviews of this his first essay in authorship, for which he
    expects a wide popularity.</p>

    <h4>FROM A SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT.</h4>

    <p><i>Thursday</i>.&mdash;To-day LARRIKIN received a visit from
    an old friend, who was visibly moved during the interview, in
    spite of the prisoner's efforts to console him. "There's
    nothing to snivel about, old man," he said repeatedly, with a
    tranquil smile. He then inquired if it was true that there were
    portraits of him in several of the papers, and was anxious to
    know if they were like him. He has executed his will, leaving
    the copyright of his manuscript, his sole assets, to his
    father, who has been in a comparatively humble position of
    life, but who will now be raised to a condition of affluence.
    The father has been interviewed, and stated to a reporter that
    he has been much gratified by the expressions of sympathy which
    have been showered upon his son from all sides. This morning a
    local florist sent LARRIKIN a beautiful wreath, in which the
    prisoner's initials and those of his victims were tastefully
    intertwined in violets. LARRIKIN was much touched, and his eyes
    filled with tears, which, however, he succeeded in repressing
    by a strong effort. His self-control and courage are the
    admiration of the officials, by whom he will be greatly missed.
    All day he has been busy packing up the furniture with which,
    by special permission, his little cell has been provided by his
    many admirers, and the interior has already lost much of its
    late dainty and cosy appearance. LARRIKIN has been whistling a
    good deal,&mdash;though, as the day wore on, the tunes he
    executed became of a less lively character. Towards evening,
    however, he recovered his ordinary high spirits, and even
    danced a "cellar-flap" for the entertainment of his Warders. A
    telegram has just been handed to him from an anonymous sender,
    who is understood to be a person of some eminence in
    bird-stuffing circles, which contained these words&mdash;"You
    are to be hung on my Aunt's silver-wedding day. Keep your
    pecker up." On reading this message. LARRIKIN came more near to
    breaking down than he has done hitherto. He has selected the
    clothes he is to wear on his last semi-public appearance; they
    consist of a plain black Angora three-button lounge coat, a
    purple velvet waistcoat, soft doeskin trousers, a lay-down
    striped collar and dickey, and a light-blue necktie with a
    glass pin. He has presented his only other jewellery&mdash;an
    oroide ring, set with Bristol diamonds&mdash;to the Warder who
    has been most attentive and devoted to him during his stay in
    gaol. He is said to have stated that he freely forgave the
    infant whose insulting conduct provoked his outburst, as he did
    the nursemaid for not restraining her charge's vivacity. This
    intimation, at his express desire, will be conveyed to the
    parents of the deceased, and will doubtless afford them the
    highest consolation.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday Night, Later</i>.&mdash;LARRIKIN is sleeping
    peacefully. His features&mdash;refined by the mental anxiety,
    and the almost monastic seclusion to which he has been lately
    subjected&mdash;are extremely pleasing, and even handsome,
    set-off as they are by the clean collar which he has put on in
    anticipation of his approaching doom. Before sinking into
    childlike slumber, he listened with evident pleasure to a banjo
    which was being played outside a public-house in the vicinity
    of the gaol. The banjoist is now being interviewed, and
    believes that the air he must have been performing at the time
    was "<i>The Lost Chord</i>." The scaffold on which the
    unfortunate LARRIKIN is to expiate his imprudent act is now
    being erected, but the workmen's hammers have been
    considerately covered with felt to avoid disturbing the
    slumberer.</p>

    <p><i>Friday Morning</i>, 9 A.M.&mdash;All is now over. The
    prisoner rose early and made a hearty breakfast, and plainly
    enjoyed the cigar which he smoked afterwards with his friend
    the Governor, who seemed to regard the entrance of the
    executioner as an untimely interruption to the conversation.
    "You'll have to wait a bit for the rest of that story,
    Governor," was LARRIKIN's light-hearted comment. The unhappy
    man then&mdash;(<i>Details follow which we prefer to leave to
    the reader's imagination&mdash;he will find them all in the
    very next special description of such a scene</i>). LARRIKIN
    was most anxious that it should be widely known that, in his
    own words, "he was true to himself and the public, and game to
    the last."</p>

    <p>Several reporters were present in the prison-yard, and also
    a number of persons of distinction, who were only admitted as a
    great favour. It is said that the prison Authorities were
    compelled to disappoint thousands who had applied for
    permission to view the last sad scene.</p>

    <p>LARRIKIN's melancholy end will doubtless operate as a
    warning and an example to many romantic youths, who are only
    too easily led away by the morbid desire for notoriety, which
    is so prevalent nowadays, and which is so difficult either to
    account for, or discourage.&mdash;(<i>Special Descriptive

    <p>Charmed to have a visit from OLD MORALITY to-day. Most kind
    of him to find time to run down, seeing all he has on hand. But
    he's a really good fellow, of the kind who in all circumstances
    find time to do a friendly thing. Always from the first taken a
    friendly interest in our little experiment. He is, indeed,
    indirectly personally responsible for its undertaking. If I
    hadn't come across him playing leapfrog before dinner with
    AKERS&mdash;DOUGLAS and JACKSON, as mentioned some weeks ago,
    SARK and I would never have tried this way of passing a
    Recess.</p>

    <p>Hadn't heard OLD MORALITY was going to look in. Expect he
    wasn't sure he could get away from Cabinet Council, and so
    didn't write. When I came upon him he was standing absorbed in
    contemplation of ARPACHSHAD. ARPACHSHAD, himself, so engrossed
    in problem occupying his mind, that he did not notice our
    visitor. Had started yesterday cutting grass on lawn with
    machine. Getting on pretty well with it till, this morning,
    wind rose, blowing half a gale from Westward. ARPACHSHAD
    discovered that, starting with machine from the Westward, he,
    with wind blowing astern, got on capitally; but coming back,
    with wind ahead, there was decided addition to labour of
    propelling machine. When OLD MORALITY arrived, ARPACHSHAD had
    halted midway across the lawn, and was looking Westward with
    air of profound and troubled cogitation.</p>

    <p>"I know what he's thinking of," said OLD MORALITY, whose
    Parliamentary experience has made him an adept at
    thought-reading; "he's wondering if it's possible to mow the
    lawn all from the Westward, so that he would have the wind
    behind him throughout the operation."</p>

    <p>No doubt OLD MORALITY had fathomed depth of ARPACHSHAD's
    meditations. Pretty to see his manoeuvring: Went down full-sail
    with assistance of favouring gale; tried to tack back, bearing
    away to the North; when he'd got a little way, slewed round to
    the West, going off before the wind to edge of lawn. Finally
    borne in upon him that the position was inexorable. He couldn't
    go with the wind all the time; must retrace his steps; by
    tacking was really covering more ground than need be; was, in
    fact, doing more work than he had intended. Shocked at this
    discovery proceeded to follow ordinary course. Presently
    catching sight of solitary leaf careering down walk, fetched
    broom, and tenderly tickled the gravel in pursuit of the
    leaf.</p>

    <p>"There is," SARK sharply observed, "nothing ARPACHSHAD
    enjoys more than dusting the walk with a broom. It is a process
    that combines the maximum of appearance of hard work with the
    minimum of exertion."</p>

    <p>OLD MORALITY pretty lively in anticipation of Session, which
    opens to-morrow. Always inclined to take sanguine view of
    situation. Doesn't vary now. "Oh, you leave it to us, TOBY,
    dear boy." he said, when I expressed hope that he would not
    risk his precious life and health by overdoing it. "We've got a
    splendid programme, and mean to pull through every Bill. Didn't
    do much last year, it is true: but don't you see the advantage
    of that? If we'd passed all our Bills last Session, must have
    arranged a new programme this year, involving considerable
    labour. As it is we turn a handle, and there are all the old
    things once more; homely and friendly; as the poet says, 'All,
    all, are come, the old familiar faces.' There's the Irish Local
    Government Bill, the Tithes Bill, Employers' Liability, and a
    troop of others. All been brought in before; everybody knows
    about them; if we don't pass them this Session they must come
    up again next."</p>

    <p>"Ha!" said SARK; "so there is to be a next Session."</p>

    <p>"Certainly," said OLD MORALITY&mdash;"and we would have
    another, if we could. In fact, I'm not quite sure whether it
    may not be managed. We are always suspending Standing Orders,
    of one kind or another. It is a Standing Order of the
    Constitution that no Parliament shall sit longer than seven
    years. Very good&mdash;in an ordinary way, excellent; though,
    perhaps, a little too liberal in its arrangements when Mr. G.
    is in power. But as you, TOBY, may, in earlier years,
    diligently striving after improvement in caligraphy, have had
    occasion to note, Circumstances alter Cases. Here we are, a
    contented Government, with a Parliamentary majority always to
    be relied upon. Why disturb an ordered state of affairs, and
    plunge the country into the turmoil and expense of a General
    Election? Why not bring in a short Bill to suspend the
    Septennial Act, and let the present Parliament go on sitting
    indefinitely? Why should the Long Parliament remain a monopoly
    of the Seventeenth Century? I do not mind telling you (this, of
    course, in confidence) that we have talked the matter over in
    the Cabinet. It was the MARKISS who first started it; and,
    though one or two objections have been raised, the idea is
    rather growing upon us, and I should not wonder if it came to
    something. You will find no mention of it in the Queen's
    Speech&mdash;but that is neither there nor here."</p>

    <p>"I have noticed," said SARK, "that of late it has happened
    that Bills mentioned in the Queen's Speech come to nothing,
    whilst the Session is largely taken up with discussion of Bills
    which find no place in that catalogue. Last year, for example,
    JOKIM's Compensation Bill wasn't mentioned in the Queen's
    Speech; and yet it filled a large part in the programme of the
    Session."</p>

    <p>"Ah," said OLD MORALITY, changing the subject, "I see
    ARPACHSHAD has nearly come up with that leaf. He'll be going to
    his dinner now, I suppose, and I think I must be off. Shall see
    you at the House to-morrow. Sorry for you to break up the
    associations of your rural life; but that only temporary."</p>

    <p>Saw OLD MORALITY off at the station. Came back to pack up
    our spade and hoe, and leave some general instructions with
    ARPACHSHAD. He seems much touched at the approaching
    separation. Quite unable to continue the lawn-mowing. Followed
    us about with his jack-knife open, clipping here and there a
    dead stem, so as to keep up an appearance of incessant
    labour.</p>

    <p>"Ours is only a change of occupation, ARPACHSHAD," said
    SARK. "We cease to labour here, but we carry on our work in
    another field. We go to town, leaving, as the Poet GRAY might
    have said, the garden to solitude and you."</p>

    <p>"Excuse <i>me</i>, Gents," said ARPACHSHAD. a look of
    anxiety crossing his mobile face, "but you can't leave it to me
    altogether. I could manage well enough when you were here,
    helpin' and workin'. But, when you're gone, I'll have to have
    at least one extry man." SARK pleased at this testimony to
    value of our assistance; but it really means that ARPACHSHAD
    intends to do less than ever, running us into the expense of a
    second gardener.</p>

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
